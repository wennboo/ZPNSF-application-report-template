\textcolor{red}{注意2：对于中文参考文献，为了保证格式正确，最好需在对应bib里面添加\text{language=\{zh\}}，不加会默认当做英文文献处理。区别如图\ref{fig_bib0}。}

  \label{fig_bib0}
\end{figure}

参考文献有两种格式引入\verb+\cite{}+以及\verb+\citep{}+。使用效果可见下面介绍:\\
1.插入会议inproceedings\cite{zhao2015bearing0}\\
2.插入教材课本book\cite{williams1991probability,chengzhaolin2006,zhangsan2007}\\
3.插入期刊article\cite{cao2011formation,xue2015formation}\\
4.插入硕博论文thesis\cite{lisi2015,wangwu2015,deans2005bearings}\\
5.插入网站misc\cite{irdawebsite,h7n9,wikipedia_moores_law}\\
6.插入专利patent\cite{xiao2012yi,p6915001}\\
7.插入新闻news报纸newspaper\cite{zhang2000,renminribao}\\
8.插入标准standard\cite{gbt3469-1983}

\textcolor{red}{注意1：参考文献格式不正确可能导致编译不通过，大家可以参考本工程中reference.bib中文献格式对网上下载不规范的bibtex文件进行修改。此外，如果上述类型里面条目有缺失会会导致编译不能输出正确格式。}
